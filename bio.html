		<h1>Biography</h1>
		<h2>Conor Trevor Ward</h2>

		<h2>I was born in San Francisco on April 24, 1994. My father is a doctor. At the time, he was an ear, nose, and throat surgeon. My mother had many professions. She worked in banking and interior design. When I was five, I started preschool, and my mom left work to become a "stay-at-home" mom. </h2>
